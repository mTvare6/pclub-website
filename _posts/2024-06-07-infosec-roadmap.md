## What is Info-Sec?

Information Security is not only about securing information from unauthorised access. Information Security is basically the practice of preventing unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information. Information can be physical or electronic. Information can be anything like your details or we can say your profile on social media, your data in mobile phone, your biometrics etc. Thus Information Security spans so many research areas like Cryptography, Mobile Computing, Cyber Forensics, Online Social Media etc.

## Why learn Information Security?

Information system means to consider available countermeasures or controls stimulated through uncovered vulnerabilities and identify an area where more work is needed. The need for Information security:

- Protecting the functionality of the organisation
- Enabling the safe operation of applications
- Protecting the data that the organisation collect and use
- Safeguarding technology assets in organisations

**Note:** In case of any doubts while going through this roadmap, You can post your query on the Infosec Channel on the discord server of Programming Club, IIT Kanpur. The roadmap is more inclined towards the offensive side of infosec.

## What are CTFs ?

CTFs (Capture the Flags) are infosec events where there are multiple infosec challenges related to various domains like rev , pwn , crypto , OSINT, forensics etc. are made available to participants where , which upon solving they find a text hidden by the problem maker called a flag. It's not a country’s flag (xD) . These events can be held both online and on-site. Some of the famous CTFs are Insomni’hack, GoogleCTF, PlaidCTF, TCTF.

A typical CTF flag would look something like : **pclub{CTFs_ar3_fun!}**

A very good video that will help in understanding the deep relation between infosec and CTFs is probably this [Infosec Intro ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ev9ZX9J45A). A great website to keep a look on old, ongoing and upcoming CTFs is [ctftime.org](http://ctftime.org). Do bookmark it !

A nice video to get even more motivated towards this domain is probably the [Mr.Robot TV Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MrQ-mN8HM8) (ignore the Dark Army part xD).

![CTF Meme](/images/ml-roadmap/infosec_chad_meme.png)

Do not worry if you don’t understand the technical terms in the meme above right now, you will surely understand most of it after completing this roadmap !

## Cyber Security

Cyber Security doesn’t refer to exploiting systems rather as the name suggests it is taking measures against them.

Understand cyber-security and domains under it:

## What is Ethical Hacking?

Ethical hacking is an authorised attempt to gain unauthorised access to a computer system, application, or data using the strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps identify security vulnerabilities that can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.

## **Week 1: Computer Organisation and Fundamentals**

To dive into the field of Information security, one first needs to understand the basic fundamentals like how computers, networks and other things work. To break the rule, you need to know the rule. But, to make it secure you need to understand the rule.

| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Day 1** | Computers only understand 0s and 1s, so first we need to understand [Number system](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/number/Numeral_system.html) ( Binary, Octal, Decimal and Hexadecimal) <br> Computers are good with 0s and 1s, but we need some other system to represent other symbols. [ASCII encoding](https://www.ascii-code.com/)|
| **Day 2** | First you need to understand the device on which you will work. Since, it lets you know how exactly each instruction is executed at micro level. <br> Cover the complete [Computer Component](https://www.javatpoint.com/computer-components) and [Computer Memory](https://www.javatpoint.com/computer-memory) heading and all its subheadings.|
| **Day 3** | Most of us use android in our day to day life. So, it becomes really important to have basic android fundamentals, which you can read [here](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)>). Must cover the [FEATURES](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Features>) and [DEVELOPMENT](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Development>) sections.                                                                                     |
| **Day 4** | Network security is one of the most important aspects to consider when working over the internet, LAN or other method. While there is no network that is immune to attacks, a stable and efficient network security system is essential to protect client data. But, before that we need to know the network fundamentals, which you can cover [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tutorials/). <br> Must cover BASICS and NETWORK SECURITY AND CRYPTOGRAPHY headings. |
| **Day 5** | There are different methodologies used in the field of cybersecurity. To secure a system against a particular method you need to know it. You can read some of them [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-hacking/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Day 6** | Before we proceed further, we need to know about [operating systems](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/operating-system-OS) and why to choose [linux over windows](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/linux-vs-windows/). <br> [Here](https://www.stackscale.com/blog/popular-linux-distributions/), you can get an overview of the popular linux distros available. Now, you will [Install Kali Linux in VirtualBox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGTD6jmYhc)          |
| **Day 7** | Building and working with the fundamentals can be tedious sometimes. So, you need tools developed by cyber communities over years to tackle problems easily. You can learn about different [important tools](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-kali-linux-tools-for-hacking/) that are used in the security field.                                                                                                                                                                            |

**TASKS:**

1. Develop a Base 12 Number System
1. Convert your name (ASCII text) to base 2,8,10,12 and 16 number systems.
1. Identify network devices around you and figure what purpose it serves and how.
1. Install a different OS distro in the virtualbox, run some services and test it with the tools installed in the first OS.

## Week 2: More on Linux, Python and Bash

Throughout the journey exploring info-security the Linux operating system will play a very crucial role may it be from initially getting onto challenges or till the reverse engineering. And thus, it becomes important to have a good understanding of Linux - the basic commands, and thus, the Unix filesystem.

And Python & bash are scripting languages and really helpful when it comes to automating the facilities of an existing system. This will be very useful, while searching for some critical keywords, in a very big file, for example.

| **Day 1 & 2** | **Linux Fundamentals** <br> Basic commands: To access the Linux os from the terminal, you must know of some basic commands. Like given [here](https://preview.redd.it/isnefnt32wn21.jpg?auto=webp&s=b6c48a27ab33a3d428b554d278eba617e35bf3a2). <br> **Unix Filesystem** <br> When working with Linux, it becomes important to understand the filesystem and the hierarchy tree, this will be useful till RE as well.<br>Which can be covered from [here](https://homepages.uc.edu/~thomam/Intro_Unix_Text/File_System.html).                                                                       |
| **Day 3 & 4** | **OverTheWire: Bandit [[Link](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)]** <br> These are interesting level-based challenges that will help you learn useful commands! This will help you understand how powerful and useful the terminal is! <br> “... You will encounter many situations in which you have no idea what you are supposed to do. Don’t panic! Don’t give up! The purpose of this game is for you to learn the basics. Part of learning the basics is reading a lot of new information. …” [It is recommended to read through the instructions and man(ual) pages before getting started!] <br> **pwn.college: Linux Luminarium [[Link](https://pwn.college/linux-luminarium/)]** <br> Similar to **OverTheWire** these are also flag-based challenges which will familiarize you with various linux commands. |
| **Day 5**     | **Python** <br> It will be used in scripting, like for searching some flags, when it will not be possible to do so manually. <br> Basic Python - [Link](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) <br> Python for scripting and automation: [Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/scripting)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Day 6**     | **Bash scripting** <br> Bash scripting is one of the easiest types of scripting to learn, and is best compared to Windows Batch scripting. Bash is very flexible, and has many advanced features that you won’t see in batch scripts.Learn Bash scripting - see this [article](https://linuxhint.com/3hr_bash_tutorial/) or [check this](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting).                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Day 7**     | **Practising scripting** <br> Here are some examples on python scripting: [Link](https://linuxhint.com/python_scripts_beginners_guide/), you should try solving them on your own. <br> To practise bash scripting, you can check [this website](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash), it has some good exercises for practice, or [this](https://tryhackme.com/room/bashscripting) also.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Day 1** | What is **Web Exploitation** and what does it cover? <br> <https://www.opensourceforu.com/2012/03/cyber-attacks-explained-web-exploitation/>Now let's start learning languages such as HTML and JS which build up the client side of the web application. On the client side, HTML gives structure to the web application while JS gives logical code of how we can interact with it. Learn **HTML** from - [HTML playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr6-GrHUlVf_ZNmuQSXdS197Oyr1L9sPB) <br> Watching till 20 should be fine for now.|
| **Day 2** | Do a crash course in **JS** - [JS crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c) <br> MDN web doc reference for JS - [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) <br>  <br> You will find MDN webdocs a great information source on how the web works. Also go through this video -  <br> [Hacker101 - JavaScript for Hackers (Created by @STÖK)](https://youtu.be/FTeE3OrTNoA?t=120) <br>  <br> Learn **Fetch API** from this crash course [Fetch API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oive66jrwBs&t=0s) and from the MDN web docs - [Fetch API - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) <br> Also try to learn the terms that you find new in the MDN web docs. <br>  <br> An important tool for web exploitation is the developer tools that almost all browsers provide. Here is a crash course on it - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTVpBbFWry8>                                                                                                                                              |
| **Day 3** | **SQL** is the language for querying data from databases and that is where all information is stored. So a knowledge of SQL is important in interfering with these queries - [SQL tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial). <br>  <br> **PHP** is a server-side scripting language and a lot of old web applications are still using them. Crash Course on PHP - [PHP Crash Course for beginners - 2020](https://youtu.be/6mO1UA1r-6Q) <br> Refer to PHP docs - [PHP docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/)|
| **Day 4** | Now after spending the last two days solely learning, now let's try to apply our knowledge and that's how you actually learn hacking!  <br> Here you can **apply your knowledge of JS** - [HTS](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/javascript/)  <br> Go to the JavaScript challenges and try to solve all of them.  <br>  <br> **XSS attacks** are a type of injection attack in which a vulnerable website is manipulated so as to send malicious scripts to some other client’s browser - [XSS attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) <br> Here is a game where you can try XSS attacks yourselves - [XSS game](https://xss-game.appspot.com/) <br>  <br> Often to exploit reflected XSS one would need a https endpoint which is provided by online websites like [RequestBin](https://pipedream.com/requestbin) <br>  <br> Another popular attack vector is **SQL injection** where the SQL queries that get data out of databases are interfered to take out data without proper authentication - [SQL injection](https://www.hacksplaining.com/prevention/sql-injection) <br> Know |
| **Day 5** | **OWASP Top-10** lists the top-10 web application vulnerabilities in the present day so this is a must know information for people into web security - [OWASP Top-10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)  <br> [The TOP 10 VULNERABILITIES In Web Applications In 2022 - OWASP Top 10 Explained](https://youtu.be/xGecBCc3lEk) <br> **BurpSuite** is another handy tool for web exploitation. You can intercept and manipulate the requests sent from your browser and many more things! - [BurpSuite](https://linuxhint.com/burpsuite_tutorial_beginners/) <br> [Burpsuite Basics (FREE Community Edition)](https://youtu.be/G3hpAeoZ4ek) <br>  <br> **DVWA** (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) will let you discover various vulnerabilities and bugs on a MySQL+PHP-based web application.  <br> First of all run the web application in a dockerized environment - [Installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) + [DVWA docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/vulnerables/web-dvwa/) [DVWA solutions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHUKi1UlEgOJLPSFZaFKMoexpM6qhOb4Q)  <br>  <br>  <br> This is not to be done completely in a day but you should go on doing it at your own pace. |

| **Day 1** | **Forensics:** The art of recovering the digital trail left on a computer. There are plenty of methods to find data which is seemingly deleted, not stored, or worse, covertly recorded. <br>  <br> [**Metadata**](https://youtu.be/HU_euJyxYB4), often described as data about data, helps in understanding the history of a particular electronic file, including when the file was created, modified and accessed, among other information that can be used to describe the file.  <br> [File signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures), or magic numbers, are unique byte sequences at the start of files that identify their format or type. They allow systems to recognize file types reliably, independent of file extensions. For example, PDFs start with 25 50 44 46 2D, and JPEGs start with FFD8. Magic numbers are essential for file verification, security, and data recovery. <br>  <br>  <br> **Tools** :  <br> [file](https://linux.die.net/man/1/file) (usually pre-installed) : used to determine file type <br> [strings ](https://linux.die.net/man/1/strings): print the strings of printable characters in files.  <br> [binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) : Analyze, reverse engineer, and extract firmware images. <br> [xxd](https://linuxhandbook.com/xxd-command/) : creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input. It can also convert a hex dump back to its original binary form. <br> [Hexeditor](https://github.com/chipmunk-sm/HexEditor) (alternatively [hexed.it](http://hexed.it) or [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.hexeditor)) : Used to read and edit the actual data in files, particularly the file headers. <br> [Exiftool](https://linux.die.net/man/1/exiftool) : Used to read and write meta information in files. <br> [Exiv2](http://www.exiv2.org/manpage.html): Image metadata manipulation tool. |

| **The Rabbit Hole** | **Heap Exploitation** - exploiting vulnerabilities that leverages memory corruption to manipulate the heap, the region of a program's memory used for dynamic allocation.<br/>You need to know about internal working of heap  before trying to find vulnerabilities. Read about it from [Nightmare Heap](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/25-heap/index.html), [Azeria Labs](https://azeria-labs.com/heap-exploitation-part-1-understanding-the-glibc-heap-implementation/). <br/>The writeups from [Nightmare CTF](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/index.html) are a good resource to learn heap exploitation along with this [github repo](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap).<br/>To get more intuition in heap exploitaion, watch videos on heap from LiveOverflow [here](https://youtu.be/HPDBOhiKaD8?si=2D8Yk_A7IL5wGVVT). <br/>Note: You'll often need specific versions of glibc to practice different heap attacks. Consider setting up different VMs or have older versions of libraries available.<br/>More resources:<br/>- [Malloc Internals](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/MallocInternals)<br/>- [Ebook](https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/) by Kapil Dhaval<br/> |

You can also try [this book](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/introduction) which covers a lot of topics in a concise manner. If you get confident in the above mentioned topics, try challenges from [pwnable.tw](https://pwnable.tw/) and  [microcorruption](https://microcorruption.com/).

| **Day 1** | **OSINT**: Open source intelligence is the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources like social media, news articles, company websites etc. to produce actionable intelligence. <br> Cyber criminals use OSINT to collect information on a target before attacking; also, OSINT can be used to help guess a user’s password. <br>   <br> **Sock Puppets** <br> Sock puppets, also known as research accounts, are online fictitious identities used to conceal the true identity of the OSINT investigator and to gain access to information that requires an account to access. Sock puppets are also created to isolate OSINT research, ensuring a separation between the personal and work lives of OSINT investigators. <br>  <br> This is **OPTIONAL** at introduction level, but a good practice! <br>  <br> This is a related blog <br> - https://xelessaway.medium.com/osint-ctf-beginner-roadmap-191d1601e48f <br> <br> How to create effective sock puppet, check  <br> - <https://web.archive.org/web/20210307173507/https://jakecreps.com/sock-puppets/> <br> - [Art of the sock](https://www.secjuice.com/the-art-of-the-sock-osint-humint/) <br> - <https://www.reddit.com/r/OSINT/comments/dp70jr/my_process_for_setting_up_anonymous_sockpuppet/> <br> &emsp; <br> Some Tools: <br> - Fake Name Generator: <https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/> <br> - AI Generated face images: <https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/> |

## What’s Next?

Information security is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer systems and physical data from unauthorised access whether with malicious intent or not.

No one becomes a successful Information Security person overnight, days, weeks or months; it takes years; it’s a continuous process of learning, revising and adapting. Emerging technologies and cyber-threats will continue to evolve. Data breaches and security incidents will happen. Rather than putting a full stop, one needs to follow up with the emerging methods and technologies.

Connect with the infosec community, build your team, participate in events, ctfs, hackathons, bug bounties; learn about new vulnerabilities, read research papers about security and most important practice what you learn in a safe environment, causing no data loss or system failure.
