# Introduction:

## What is APP DEVELOPMENT?

Nothing much fancy or too mysterious to tell about. But basically, app development epitomizes the meticulous orchestration of intricate software applications poised to traverse an extensive gamut of platforms including mobile apparatus, desktop interfaces, and web conduits. This cerebral undertaking is underscored...

More of a boring stuff right? But what we believe here in PClub is that app development is the magical process of turning your wildest ideas into little digital buddies that live on your devices. Imagine having a personal army of tiny obedient robots ready to entertain you, keep you informed about your girlfriend’s message, or even help you order pizza at 2 AM. That's app development in a nutshell! Interesting, huh? :)

## Why APP DEVELOPMENT?

- Learning app development enhances essential technical skills like coding, problem-solving, and software design. It cultivates proficiency in programming languages alongside familiarity with development frameworks and tools.
- Mastering app development equips individuals with in-demand abilities crucial for careers in technology, providing a solid foundation for growth and specialization within the industry.

## Choosing A Framework

What framework should I use for App Dev?

Now here comes the most fundamental question about choosing the framework. There exist many options for that like React Native, Flutter, Ionic, Xamarin, etc. Now we will be using Flutter as our framework further in our roadmap.

Wait, what? You want to know why? Well, why wouldn't we use Flutter? I mean who doesn't love darting around with a fluttering feeling of excitement? If this doesn’t make sense, watch these videos to find out about what Flutter is, what that darting means, and why we should use it.

- [Why flutter?](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/02/21/why-flutter-is-the-most-popular-cross-platform-mobile-sdk/)

Now as you have decided to use Flutter, let us start.

But before starting, you should know that learning Flutter is a wild ride and there is no better way than to enjoy it with some memes? As you can see on this page, these memes might initially make you go “What the Flutter?" But trust us, by the time you're a Flutter pro, you will grasp these memes faster than your app crashes during a live demo. So buckle up, get ready to code, and enjoy the fun side of Flutter!

## Week I (Learning Dart And Basics of Flutter)

Throughout our journey, the best resource to look up is the official documentation of Flutter, well maintained and updated by Google.

- [Flutter Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)

For Dart, refer to this

- [Dart Documentation](https://dart.dev/guides)

For Flutter Packages, refer to pub official site

- [Flutter Packages](https://pub.dev/)

### Day 1 – Exploring and Installing Flutter

The crucial first step in our journey is to set up our development environment. So go ahead and install Flutter SDK using the guide [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). Or you can follow the [VS Code Intallation](https://youtu.be/1KidD72q87s?feature=shared) and [Android Studio Installation](https://youtu.be/mMeQhLGD-og?feature=shared). After installation, you need to test the setup. So follow these steps to Test a Sample App.You don’t need to worry about the files and the code, you will grasp it soon.

- [Test drive - Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive)

Let’s learn about Hot Reload and Restart—the dynamic duo of Flutter development. Hot Reload is the magical button that instantly fixes your app's mess-ups while Hot Restart is for when you’ve really messed up and need a fresh start. Watch this to know more:

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeR09zZ8xrU" style="text-decoration: none; color: #FF0000;">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/YouTube_full-color_icon_%282017%29.svg" alt="YouTube Icon" width="20" height="20" >
    Flutter Tutorial - How To Use Hot Reload & Hot Restart In 4 Minutes
  </a>

- [Hot Reload - Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/hot-reload)

Till now you must have known that Flutter uses Dart as its language. We can think of Flutter as Iron Man's stunning suit attracting all the attention whereas Dart's the arc reactor, the hidden power core that keeps him going. Read [this](https://hackernoon.com/why-flutter-uses-dart-dd635a054ebf) blog to know more about why Flutter uses Dart.

### Day 2 – Revealing The Mysteries of Dart

Dart is like the distant cousin of Java. They both share that “strong" and “static" typing DNA but Dart throws in some new moves like optional semicolons and an inclination for Fluttering around mobile app development.
If you are familiar with Java or some other programming languages, then you will find Dart very similar with some new things added. Go through this tutorial to get familiar with the language:

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_Pcr4uC2Q" style="text-decoration: none; color: #FF0000;">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/YouTube_full-color_icon_%282017%29.svg" alt="YouTube Icon" width="20" height="20" >
    Dart Programming Tutorial - Full Course
  </a>

For diving deeper, check out the Language part of Docs up to Error Handling:

- [https://dart.dev/language](https://dart.dev/language)

You can practice your concepts on [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/), the online editor for Dart.

### Day 3 and 4 – OOP In Dart

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/db/95/45/db954597f5b2dfd705ec98f05b8c24ce.jpg" alt="OOP in Dart" width="300px">
</div>

In Dart, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is as integral as a knight's armour in battle. Dart supports OOP through its robust class-based system where everything revolves around classes and objects. Dart's OOP features inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, allowing developers to create complex interlinked structures with ease.

Now if you are familiar with Classes and Objects in some other language, just go through [this](https://dart.dev/language/classes) Docs to grasp the syntax. If you are new to OOP, go through these videos to grasp what is OOP and why we need it:

- <a href="https://youtu.be/6Ff5ls0TXHU?si=cykIQg9fg5xpxgGH" style="text-decoration: none; color: #FF0000;">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/YouTube_full-color_icon_%282017%29.svg" alt="YouTube Icon" width="20" height="20" >
    What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
  </a>

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ONhXmQuWP8&t=174s" style="text-decoration: none; color: #FF0000;">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/YouTube_full-color_icon_%282017%29.svg" alt="YouTube Icon" width="20" height="20" >
    Object Oriented Programming - The Four Pillars of OOP
  </a>

After grasping the basics, go through any one of these docs to learn particularly about OOP in Dart:

- [Classes - Dart](https://dart.dev/language/classes)
- [Dart Object-Oriented Concepts](https://medium.com/@nehatanwar.dev/what-is-oops-in-dart-76828b894b79)

Learning is incomplete without Application of Concepts. Try to solve the problem 1 and 2 given in this document [DART ASSIGNMENT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q8FRvTydVIBgR7lptIuR_Xt6J_H49ld7rVjOudCNgwM/edit).
(Optional) You are highly recommended to do the problem 3 also but not necessary.

### Day 5 – Entering The “Upside Down” Of Flutter

Let us create our first app in Flutter. Prepare for an epic adventure where you’ll meet exotic creatures like ‘setState' and ‘buildContext'. Get ready to dive into the wonderful world of widgets and hot reloads. You don’t need to memorize the code. Just make sure you are understanding most of the code. Just follow this codelab:

- <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0" style="text-decoration: none; color: #32de84;">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Google_Developers_icon_2020.png" alt="Google Icon" width="20" height="20" >

### Day 6 and 7 – Forget Netflix, Try WidgeFlix!

Now when you have built your first app, get to know about the basic widgets more:

- [Building user interfaces with Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui)

The widgets in our app are arranged in a tree form called a widget tree. Get to know more about it:

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSt1qSNY1O0" style="text-decoration: none; color: #FF0000;">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/YouTube_full-color_icon_%282017%29.svg" alt="YouTube Icon" width="20" height="20" >
     Widget Tree - Flutter
  </a>

First get introduced to the very basic stateless and stateful widgets. Even before, get to know what is state? Also, you can check out the blog as well.

Wanna chill a bit? Check out Google's this playlist—because who doesn't love binge-watching UI components? It's like a Netflix series but with excitement about buttons and sliders. You really don’t need to go through all the videos and mug up the code. Just get to know a few of them and use them when you build your app:

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?l    <h3>Karan Keer</h3>ist=PLjxrf2q8roU23XGwz3Km7sQZFTdB996iG" style="text-decoration: none; color: #FF0000;">
     <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/YouTube_full-color_icon_%282017%29.svg" alt="YouTube Icon" width="20" height="20" >
      Widget of the Week 
  </a>

We know that’s not enough to quench your thirst for adventure, so let us dive into these codelabs to clear our concepts of creating layouts:

- <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-flutter?hl=en#0" style="text-decoration: none; color: #32de84;">

  </a>

Flutter gives you another upper hand through widgets like [MaterialApp](https://youtu.be/PNS2Jk7Yx8Y?feature=shared) and [Scaffold](https://youtu.be/gtxP_ck-jCc?feature=shared) — they’re like building blocks or LEGO pieces that let you quickly assemble beautiful, responsive apps with full control over structure and design.

## Week II (UI Design and State Management)

If you survived the WidgeFlix, then let us step into week second where we’re diving into the world of UI design, covering everything from navigation, interactivity to animations, theming, responsiveness, and asset management.

### Day 1 - App Navigation - Starring Buttons, Screen Drama and Plot Twists

Welcome to Day 1, where your app will navigate like navigating a dream within a dream within a route within a route. By the end, it'll be switching screens smoother than a plot twist in Inception—because who needs mind-bending movies when your app's the real master of suspense? Check this out to know what are routes .

### Day 3 & 4 - Layouts, Responsiveness, Adaptability and Animations

Let’s get along with Day 3 & 4, where we're about to turn our app so responsive, that they'll adapt quicker than a chameleon camouflaging with its surroundings. Let's stretch those screens and bend those designs—it's time to make your app as adaptable as Jeff Bezos' business strategy!

First learn about responsiveness:

Wait, what? Are you exhausted already? Brace yourself, because after this, “Winter Is Coming”. We're going to dive into storage, networking, backend integration, testing, debugging, deployment… The White Walkers of app development. Get ready to wield your coding skills like Valyrian steel, because this is where the real battle begins!

## Week III (Networking)

Welcome to the networking section, where you’ll find out that ‘connection refused’ isn’t just about your social life. In most apps, you'll need data from other devices, and this week will teach you exactly how to collaborate with people because your code can't live in splendid isolation forever, and neither can you!

### Day - 1 Introduction to protocols

On our first day let us enter the world of protocols, where rules are like the Matrix code—seemingly complex, but once deciphered, you'll feel like Neo bending reality.
Get to know about protocols [here](https://medium.com/@asqprotocol/what-is-a-protocol-78c363ec39fd)

</a>
</div>

Now you might be getting a hang of how computers "communicate".

<div>
Let us dive deep into http now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm0-cm5u2ak&t=408s" style="text-decoration: none; color: #FF0000;">
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/YouTube_full-color_icon_%282017%29.svg" alt="YouTube Icon" width="20" height="20">
  What are HTTP servers?
</a>

Watch till _28:21_ timestamp.

</div>

Now learn about http methods here:

- [An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)
- [HTTP Methods - REST API Tutorial](https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/)

### Day - 2 Dive into API, JSON & Making Requests

Think of APIs as virtual postmen for apps—delivering data packets, exchanging messages, and occasionally getting lost in the digital equivalent of a maze, leaving behind a trail of '404: Address Not Found' signs. Learn more about it - [What exactly is an API?](https://medium.com/@perrysetgo/what-exactly-is-an-api-69f36968a41f)

Here is a presentation to give you further insights on [How real life applications gather data from around the world?](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJvXLtfZ4/jB5Clq5GUtfbisDLddL48g/view?utm_content=DAGJvXLtfZ4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is like the language that Postman uses to deliver messages between apps and servers. Imagine each JSON object as a letter, where curly braces {} are envelopes containing key-value pairs—like addresses and messages. More about it - [What is JSON?](https://restfulapi.net/introduction-to-json/)

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/78/64/b57864c34501eaab43ed7c32bdc2e130.jpg" width="250px">
    
</div>

Before learning to handle JSON in flutter, learn about asynchronous programming in flutter.

- [What is Async and Await in Flutter?](https://medium.com/@nehatanwar.dev/what-is-async-and-await-in-flutter-17acdcd05b6a#:~:text=In%20the%20main%20function%2C%20we,and%20the%20program%20continues%20execution.)

Learn how to handle JSON in flutter - [Parsing complex JSON in Flutter](https://medium.com/flutter-community/parsing-complex-json-in-flutter-747c46655f51)

Now that you have understand all the pieces, you should play around with api requests to get the feel of it. To play around, browse the web for free and accessible api's or you can find some [here](https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis).
Choose an api, and hit the endpoint using [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), fullfilling all the requirements listed on the api doc while making the request, and then observe what you recieve.

### Day - 3 Flutter package : Http

Now that you are clear with the basics, it is time to learn how to exactly implement it in your flutter workflow

Explore the [Flutter cookbook on networking](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/networking) for an eye-opening experience (_Leave the websockets part_).

Http package is great to begin with, but there is another package that is preferred dio, because of it's rich features and advanced capabilities. You can look into it - [Dio](https://pub.dev/documentation/dio/latest/)
_Note: this roadmap will stick to http for learning purposes_

## Week IV (Storage & Stepping into Backend)

### Day - 1 Intro to storage, Shared Preferences

It is hard to find a real life application that does not store any data on the user's device. Welcome to the world of storage, where your app learns to remember things, just like you never forget your coffee in the morning!

Read [this](https://medium.com/@chetan.akarte/describe-different-options-for-persistent-data-storage-in-flutter-16adc9dd5d0d) to take first step into storage in flutter.
_Note: We will not exactly follow the listed ways to approach storage, spoiler alert! This was just to give a brief intro._

Let’s dive into the basics and get our hands dirty with Shared Preferences, the sticky notes of app storage.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa_U0jffQII&t=33s" style="text-decoration: none; color: #FF0000;">
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/YouTube_full-color_icon_%282017%29.svg" alt="YouTube Icon" width="20" height="20" >
  Flutter: shared_preferences package Intro
</a>

If you prefer reading refer the [shared preferences cookbook](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/key-value)

 <div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/da/92/d8/da92d86f010bfd1f12a6123daf245178.jpg" width="300px">
    
</div>
Always refer to the offical [docs](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences/example) to dive deep into the functionalities.

This [article](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-use-sharedpreferences-in-flutter) will fast track you to learn all basic functionalities of shared preferences, now over to coding!

Try to code a simple UI app that makes use of shared preferences to store user prefrences. Think of ways where you can use shared preferences, and try to build it, like saving the theme of the app, or like in the weather app you built before, to store the user preference of Celcius or Fahrenheit.
You get the idea, it is your job to paint it. When you move forward, it will help you achieve better idea of where to use which kind of storage.

You can also refer to this sample tutorial:

### Day - 2 Flutter Secure Storage, Path Provider

Now we’re stepping up our game. Secure storage is like a vault for sensitive data, and path provider helps your app find a safe place to keep its treasures.

Finding the right path is crucial,whether it's the entry to the EDM night of Antaragni, or the exact path to store files in your device.

Flutter provides [File](https://pub.dev/documentation/file/latest/file/File-class.html) class which enables to open, close, read, write and delete files for the specified file path. Before saving data to a file, the location of the file has to be known.

[Path Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider) package allows you to navigate through directories and files.

_Note: You are highly recommended to read the supported methods of the [file](https://pub.dev/documentation/file/latest/file/File-class.html) class to tailor the code according to your fit :)_

Learn about its implementation in the [cookbook.](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/reading-writing-files)

[Flutter Secure Storage](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage): For data that requires protection, just like your favorite snack hidden from your siblings.

[Guide](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/guide-to-flutter-secure-storage-protect-your-dat) to all things secured.

Read [this](https://medium.com/@TeddyYeung/safeguarding-your-flutter-app-why-you-should-utilize-flutter-secure-storage-including-protection-701a627d3889) to grow your appreciation for the secure storage.

### Day - 3 Local Databasing

Welcome to the arena of local databases!
We have broadly 2 types of local storage options, one type are classified as SQL and other NoSql. (No rocket science)

Today you will be learning about the popular NoSql choices.

In one corner, we have ObjectBox, the speed demon with a black belt in data kung fu. And in the other corner, Hive, the lightweight contender that stings like a bee and floats like a... well, a hive, I guess. Let's dive in!

_You can stick with one of the above, and we recommend ObjectBox if you do so_

#### Hive:

- [Hive Docs](https://docs.hivedb.dev/#/)

- [Make a Notes App with ObjectBox](https://medium.com/@nandhuraj/building-a-simple-note-app-with-flutter-and-objectbox-9186aa0f14bc)

This [article](https://medium.com/codimis/how-to-store-and-access-data-locally-in-a-flutter-mobile-app-part-ii-75582f8de28e) sums up our long day!

**It goes without saying you are highly recommended to go through the docs of either service.**

### Day - 4 (SQL Database & Intro to Firebase)

#### SQL Database: SQLite

SQL is like that reliable old Toyota in your driveway. It's not flashy, it won't turn heads, but it'll get you where you need to go without complaining. It's been around longer than some of you have been alive (no offense, Gen Z), and it's not going anywhere anytime soon.

Why use SQLite? Well, it's like having a tiny, obedient genie living in your app. It's serverless, requires zero configuration, and is more reliable than your friend who swears they'll pay you back "next week". Plus, it's ACID-compliant, which sounds like a bad trip but is actually a good thing in database land.

If this is your first interaction with SQLite, you can check out the [SQLite Tutorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)

Now coming over to Flutter specifics,

As always, the go to resources:

- [Cookbook](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/sqlite)
- [SQLite flutter pub docs](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite)

Now to give you the feel of its implementation, as always try to implement this instead of other services you used in your previous projects, or you can come up with an application from scratch entirely.

Here are model tutorials in article and video formats

- [Flutter Sqlite Tutorial](https://www.tutorialkart.com/flutter/flutter-sqlite-tutorial/#gsc.tab=0)

### Day - 2 & 3 Diving Deep Into Testing

Learn about the different tests by referring to the respective blogs and videos.

#### Unit Tests: The Illusion of Perfection

These are the tiny oasis of control in the vast desert of app development. Here, you isolate a single piece of your code, coddle it, and make sure it behaves exactly how you expect.

- [Mastering Unit Testing in Flutter: Comprehensive Guide with Examples](https://medium.com/@piyushhh01/mastering-unit-testing-in-flutter-comprehensive-guide-with-examples-4a2bafd1f10f)

#### Widget Tests: Interactivity Defined

Widget tests are like having a team of perfectionists for your UI. They meticulously check every interactive element of your app, from buttons to sliders, ensuring flawless performance.

#### Integration Tests: The Great Betrayal

Integration tests are where you naively believe that all your perfectly tested units and widgets will play nice together. Infact, they may or maybe not. Get ready for the chaos!

#### UI Tests: The Visualisers

UI tests are like app detectives with magnifying glasses, checking every pixel and interaction to catch bugs before users do. So, get ready to inspect every button click and animation with the precision of a hawk on a hunt.

#### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

CI/CD is the backbone of modern software development practices. It streamlines the integration and deployment of code changes into production environments. By automating the build, test, and deployment processes, CI/CD ensures that software updates are delivered swiftly and reliably, maintaining the integrity and stability of applications throughout their lifecycle.
Further to learn more about CI/CD testing (In general testing), you can refer to the official [documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/overview).

### Day - 4 Debugging

Debugging is like being a detective in a digital mystery. When bugs pop up after testing, it's time to channel your inner Sherlock Holmes. So let us learn more about the techniques and tools for the same.
